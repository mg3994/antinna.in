# Introduction
This is a project generated by [salvo-cli](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-cli). You can run the program and test according to the following commands (for non-sqlite databases, please modify the database connection string first according to the tutorial, and complete the initial work of the data).
😄 The latest version of Salvo requires Rust version 1.80. If your compilation fails, please try upgrading with `rustup update`.
``` shell
//Run the project
cargo run
//Run tests
cargo test
```
# Tip
- If the database is sqlite or the database migration has been run, please use the account zhangsan with password 123 to login.
- The database connection string is in config/config.toml, but if you use sqlx or seaorm, the library itself reads the configuration from .env file to generate entities, run migrations, and validate. So when you modify the database connection string, you need to change two places at the same time.
# orm doc or home page link
🎯 You have chosen sqlx, documentation can be viewed here:https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx
## sqlx_cli

### Fix: Service Worker SSL Error on Localhost
```
Service Worker registration failed: SecurityError
An SSL certificate error occurred when fetching the script.
```

## ❌ Problem

When registering a Service Worker on:
`f12 --> Console`


Chrome requires a **valid HTTPS certificate** to register Service Workers.  
Self-signed or invalid certificates will cause registration to fail.

---

# ✅ Quick Development Fix (Windows)

Launch Chrome with special flags to bypass SSL validation.

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" ^
--ignore-certificate-errors ^
--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://127.0.0.1:8008 ^
--user-data-dir=C:\tmp_chrome
```
==> it will open new chrome App instance , test your same endpoint there
⚠ Important:
If you use 127.0.0.1 in the browser, use the same in the flag.
Do not mix localhost and 127.0.0.1

let consider you are testing service worker with https (secure mode is on endpoint) <foor example localhost:8008> ,
it will not accept the service worker fil for navigator 
to accept ==>
```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost:8008 --user-data-dir=C:\tmp_chrome
```
